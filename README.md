# Video-Link-Generator

This is a Thumbnail preview generator for Youtube videos. Most email clients don't accept video embedments so the best workaround to that is to create a thumbnail with the youtube play button and link the video to the picture.

This does exactly that and gives you the HTML code to place in your email. 

Created with the CSS framework: Foundation, jQuery, and PNG images created with Sketch that are hosted on my server.
